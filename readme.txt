Tome of Teleportation
---------------------

Tome of Teleportation organises all of your teleporting spells and items into
a single window.  If the item needs to be equipped then it will automatically
be unequipped after you have teleported. The Tome also lets you create macros
to use the spells.  Just type /tele to open the Tome, or click on the icon next
to the minimap.

The buttons in the Tome of Teleportation will each be one of three colours:
* Green: You can cast this spell now.
* Yellow: This spell is on cooldown. The cooldown remaining is displayed on 
  the button.
* Red: This item is cast using an item that must be equipped. Click on the 
  button once to equip it.  If this doesn't start a cooldown, then click again
  to teleport.  Once the summon is successful or you close the Tome the item
  will be unequipped.
  
You can create a macro for a teleportation item by Ctrl + clicking the button.
The macro will be placed on your cursor and it can be dragged onto an action 
bar. This macro acts like the buttons in the Tome, with the first click 
equipping the item and the second click using it.

Advanced Options
----------------

The /tele command can be used for advanced options. The following commands are 
available:

/tele move x y
Move the window to the specified location. For example "/tele move 100 200".

/tele reset
Move the window back to the centre of the screen. Useful if the window is moved 
off the edge of the screen.

/tele showicon
Show the minimap icon.

/tele hideicon
Show the minimap icon.

Adding New Items or Spells
--------------------------

I don't update this addon very often, so it's likely that there are some items 
missing from the tome. The Tome of Customisation addon allows you to add new items
and spells, and is included in this package. See Customisation.txt for instructions
on how to install and use this.

Known Issues
------------

It is not possible to open or close Tome of Teleportation while in combat due 
to restrictions in the way addons work.
